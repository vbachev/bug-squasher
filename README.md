Bug-Squasher
=====

This is still in development and will improve â€¦

Background
-----

Bug-squasher is an experiment and a training exercise. It finds a semi-practical application to the evolution algorythms I played with in my [genetic-sandbox](https://github.com/vbachev/genetic-sandbox) to form a simple game-like experience. On the other hand it is a training on using a CommonJS modular approach to JS (using requirejs), loosely-coupled classes and some design patterns. 

In the end it could turn out to be a proof-of-concept of a simple evolutionary game mechanics.

Gameplay
-----

Bugs are born and randomly crawl on the play-field. They will lay eggs periodically which in turn give birth to more bugs. Bug traits (movement speed, reproduction rate and others) mutate and evolve with every generation.

As in nature the bugs that escape you will pass their genes to the next generations and thus they will become ever harder to squash :)

Bug-Squasher
=====

Try out a [demo here](http://vasilbachev.com/demo/bug-squasher/)!

This is still in development and will improve â€¦

Gameplay
-----

Bugs are born and randomly crawl on the play-field. They will lay eggs periodically that in turn give birth to more bugs. Bug traits (movement speed, reproduction rate and others) mutate and evolve with every generation.

As in nature the sneakier bugs will escape you and pass their genes to the next generations. Thus they will become ever harder to squash :)

Background
-----

Bug-squasher is an experiment and a training exercise. It finds a semi-practical application to the evolution algorythms I played with in my [genetic-sandbox](https://github.com/vbachev/genetic-sandbox) to form a simple game-like experience. On the other hand it is a training on using a CommonJS modular approach to JS (using requirejs), loosely-coupled classes and some design patterns. 

In the end it could turn out to be a proof-of-concept of a simple evolutionary game mechanics. Sounds sooo sexy :)

What's to come
-----

* Still need to balance bug movement, evolution and reproduction so user experience can improve (it sucks now ...)
* need to improve click input response and effect (it lags a bit)
* think of some object templating or maybe switch to canvas because chasing red circles doesnt really do it :)
